<h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
I was firstly caught by the changing button on the website. It turned bigger after you clicking it.
      
     
<h3>2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h3>
Firstly I was draw attention to the title on the page and then saw the title and the author of the website. Right after that, it became smaller and went to the top left corner of the page.
Then I saw 7 green rectangles on the page with a word on their heads, so I moved my mouse on one rectangle and found that it can be clicked. 
After that, the rectangle became bigger and turned yellow. A green colour word appeared on it and kept turning into the next one. There were sounds playing along with each word. Then I clicked the button again. The sound stopped as well as the poem.
Out of curiosity, I enabled all of the button at once. The sounds and the words of poems altogether working, flashing, and playing. 
Then I notice a moving “X” on the bottom right corner, I moved my cursor on it, then a side-menu popped up from the right border of the page. At the same time, the “X” accelerated its motion. 


<h3>3. What element did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
I spent the most time at clicking the buttons and see the words change.


<h3>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
  My most common action is clicking the buttons.

<h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
According to website's name “7 poems”, I think its intended primary goal is to let the users create their own 7 poems.

<h3>6.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal? </h3>
For me after I playing a few rounds, I found that each button is one poem. It's not what I initially think about.
 I thought it's like use seven words to make your own poem. I think it is because the designer used only one colour throughout the website.
 Personally, I think this website' goal is not that clear for me.

 <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
 For each poem, it takes me around 1 minute to read the whole  one. When sometimes the word changed so fast, it happened to me take another round clicking the button. I think the whole experience is effective.

 <h3>8.What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
 Personally, I hope users are able to find more ways to interact with the website over time instead of the repetition of first page/button/sound we already experienced. Something like unlock-able, rewarding and hidden stages. This way, the interactive experience is longer-lasting, more fun and more successful.

<h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
It contains sounds, some mouse hover effect, plus a little animation existing all the time on the down right corner.


<h3>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
The sound suggest to me that by clicking the button it can be played/muted. The little “X” on the right bottom page suggest to me that there might be some more content if my mouse is put on it. The hover effect suggest that there might be more interaction by clicking on it.

<h3>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</h3>
The sound makes the how poem or interaction more powerful, more solemn, more emotionally punchy. 
Plus, the poems the designer chose aren't with many words but a few words, which adds even more power to the emotional delivery. 
The animation on the bottom right is the only thing that is self-moving instead of clicking or any action taken by the user, it provides a contrast to the rest of the interactive elements, bringing the whole website more sense of “alive”. Personally, I would feel bored, or too “silent” about a website that is only “moving” only when the user click or take certain actions.


<h3>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
The change of word is a little bit fast so it takes more time to engage and understand it.


<h3>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</h3>
I really like the sound playing along with the change of words. It creates a majestic atmosphere for me to read each word and gain a motion for me to interact with these words. 
I think by adding the sound, the designer somehow adds a motion to the words, making the emotional delivery much more powerful. Also, with the different pitches of sound of the button that plays, they allow users to potentially create some rhythm or music by clicking the buttons, very interesting.
